## Intro

Notion is a powerful tool for knowledge management. It's flexibility and extensibility make it a great personal knowledge library and common workspace. Lots of people are using it to store their knowledge and collaborate with others, exchanging ideas and creating new knowledge.

But those knowledge are still static, and you have to search for the knowledge you need, and you have to read them to get the answer you want. It's not very efficient, and it's not very smart.

Did you even dream of having an AI assistant that is based on your own Notion library, not only help you review your knowledge base, and talk like a senior butler, even answer others questions just like a master of your own library?
